======

Project provides tools for processing speech and speech related data. 

The ripley speech tools library is an exploration into common problems in the speech processing and recognition community.
In consideration of issues around growing data sets, the initial goal of the library is to utilize an open-source language
modeling toolkit in combination with the MapReduce?? paradigm to enable distributed training of n-gram language models.
This is part of a larger project goal to develop capabilities required to condition, decode, and understand large volumes
of speech content. 

The project was started in October 2014, and first uploaded to a public repository in December 2014 with a first
implementation of distributed language model training with preexisting open source software packages. The project
is maintained by Kyle White.
